# LearningGIS


Here is a repository of my notes and code while I learn QGIS with Python.


Lesson 1 -
<ul>
  <li>Basic geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons</li> 
  <li>How to create and manipulate geometries in Python using the Shapely Python Package</li>
  <li>Search for information about the available GIS packages in Python</li>
  <li>Understand how geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons are represented in Python using Shapely</li>
  <li>Create geometric objects based on coordinate values</li>
</ul>

Lesson 2 -
<ul>
  <li>How to handle spatial data in Python using Geopandas</li>
  <li>How to read and write spatial data in Python, and to manipulate geometries in a GeoDataFrame</li>
  <li>How to re-project data between coordinate reference systems (crs)</li>
  <li>Read and write spatial data from/to common file formats</li>
  <li>Conduct simple analysis on spatial and non-spatial data</li>
  <li>Manage coordinate reference systems and re-project data</li>  
</ul>
