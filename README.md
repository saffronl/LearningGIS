Here is a repository of my notes and code while I learn QGIS with Python.


Lesson 1 -
<li>Focus on basic geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons</li> 
<li>Learn how to create and manipulate geometries in Python using the Shapely Python Package</li>
<li>Search for information about the available GIS packages in Python</li>
<li>Understand how geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons are represented in Python using Shapely</li>
<li>Create geometric objects based on coordinate values</li>
